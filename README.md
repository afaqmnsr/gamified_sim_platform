# 🎓 Gamified Algorithm Simulator Platform

A full-stack educational web platform designed to teach algorithms through **interactive simulations**, **symbolic correctness checking**, and **sustainability-aware feedback**. The platform leverages gamification to motivate students, offering a visually rich, hands-on environment where learners can explore, verify, and optimize their solutions in Python and JavaScript.

Developed as part of a master's thesis at the University of Stavanger, this full-stack system aims to address key gaps in algorithm education by integrating constructivist pedagogy, sustainability metrics, and formal verification into one cohesive experience.

## 🎯 Motivation

This platform was designed to address enduring challenges in algorithm education:

- ❌ Insufficient interactive visual tools for understanding algorithm behavior  
- ❌ Lack of emphasis on correctness verification in student submissions

By combining 🎮 gamification, 🧠 symbolic execution, and 🌱 sustainability-aware feedback, this platform empowers learners to **explore, experiment, and optimize** algorithmic solutions with **real-time insights** and **unlockable progression**.  

The approach draws from constructivist pedagogy and formal methods to support deeper, more engaging computational learning.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✨ **Interactive Algorithm Visualizer** for graph, sorting, Petri net, and dynamic programming simulations.
- 🎮 **Gamified Assignments** with unlockable tasks and a leaderboard system.
- 🧠 **Symbolic Execution Engine** for correctness verification using Z3 SMT solver.
- 🌱 **Sustainability Feedback** through time/memory/energy metrics.

- Do **not** commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `.env.example` to document necessary variables

---

## 🧰 Deployment Notes

- Run `npm run build` in frontend and serve `dist/`
- Secure backend with HTTPS, CORS, and cookies
- Use production-ready services (Gunicorn, Nginx, Atlas)
- Set up proper user authentication and DB whitelisting

## 🩹 Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Fix                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MongoDB not connecting       | Ensure MongoDB is running locally or update `MONGO_URI`             |
| Python service fails         | Use Python 3.10+, activate venv, install all Flask packages         |
| Ace Editor not loading       | Ensure files are under `frontend/public/ace/` and Vite serves them  |
| CORS/OPTIONS error           | Update backend CORS settings for correct port and credentials       |
| Ports already in use         | Kill processes or change dev ports in .env and scripts              |

---

## 🔍 Known Limitations

- ⚠️ **Recursive or unbounded loops** may cause symbolic analysis to hang or timeout.
- 🚫 **JavaScript symbolic execution** is not yet supported—only Python is verified via Z3.
- 🧪 **No live user deployment** — the system was tested locally with seeded users and manual testing.
- 🧰 **Scalability constraints** may arise; sandboxing and load-handling are not yet optimized for production.

---

## ✅ Evaluation Instrumentation

While the system was not deployed in a live classroom, extensive evaluation capabilities were built-in:

- 🔍 **Symbolic Logs**: Tracks assignment submissions, retries, and symbolic correctness outcomes.  
- 📊 **Sustainability Metrics**: Captures execution time, memory, and energy proxies for each run.  
- 🎓 **Gamified Progression Logs**: Logs task unlocks, completion order, and leaderboard activity.

These features support future empirical studies and align with the research questions defined in the thesis (RQ1–RQ3), covering **learning outcomes**, **optimization behavior**, and **sustainability awareness**.
